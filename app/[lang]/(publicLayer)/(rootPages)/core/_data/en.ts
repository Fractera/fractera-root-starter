Not because developers do not know about it — but because holding that standard inside a framework is genuinely hard. Too many small things quietly push a page off static generation and into dynamic rendering. And the difference is not five percent, or ten: in some cases the load on your server grows a thousandfold, and your bill for servers and platforms grows with it. Fractera is built on one long experience: more than thirty years of web development. Everything about heavy load, search optimisation and saving on databases is written into the DNA of this project. It is its skeleton and its life force. And it is yours for free.',

Every service bills you separately, and every bill grows as you do. Moving looks impossible — it is not: Fractera takes your project apart and rebuilds it on its own architecture, on your server, where all of that is already there and costs nothing extra. It does not matter what your project is written in — Next, React, Vue, Laravel, WordPress, plain PHP: the agent reads your code as a description of what your project does, and builds that meaning here.

An efficient application is in your interest only; whoever sells you services has an interest in you buying and paying for as many separate ones as possible. The expensive part comes later — breaking the law and being fined over where the data sits, unforeseen shutdowns, sanctions, and simply losing your data.

From there the agent READS the foreign code as a description rather than running it — capabilities move across, files do not, so a broken or hostile dependency has no way to ride along. The first artefact is the intent tree: what your project becomes on this architecture. Then the capability table, each line ticked off with a proof, and a queue of steps born from the reading rather than from generalities. It all starts with four decisions — the type of application, whether it needs authorization, whether it needs role-based access, and which roles: the answer relays the skeleton rather than edits a page, which is why it is asked before the first line.
